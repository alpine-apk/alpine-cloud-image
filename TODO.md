* save uploaded to metadata after uploading
* make storage authoritative for state
* self.storage.get_latest_published (or released)
* don't upload if we've already uploaded
* don't import/publish if the cloud provider can't do that.
* release generates releases.yaml, sets "released"
* make sure --revise does the right thing
